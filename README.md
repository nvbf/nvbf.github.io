nvbf.github.io
==============

A simple website presenting (open source) volleyball software mainly from the [NVBF](https://github.com/nvbf/) organization on Github.

However, since the website is hosted at <https://programvare.volleyball.no/> some commercial software,
commonly used in the top 2 divisions in Norway, are presented too.
