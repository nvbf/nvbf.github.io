Translation of the official volleyball rules
==============

There is an ongoing effort to translation the complete
[official volleyball rules](https://www.fivb.com/volleyball/the-game/official-volleyball-rules/)
to Norwegian. Currently only part 2 section 3 (diagrams) is missing.

The source code of the translation and website is located on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/nvbf/spilleregler/).

## Website with the official rules in Norwegian
